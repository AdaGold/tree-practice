# Tree Exercise

In this exercise you will implement, in Ruby, several Tree methods.

- `add(value)` - This method adds a value to the Binary Search Tree
- `find(value)` - This method returns true if the given value is in the tree and false otherwise.
- `inorder` - This method returns an array of all the elements in the tree, in order.
- `postorder` - This method returns an array of all the elements in a postorder fashion (left, right , root).
- `preorder` - This method returns an array of all the elements in a preorder fashion (root, left, right).
- `height` - This method returns the height of the binary search tree.

## Optionals

- `bfs` - This method returns an array with the tree elements in a level-by-level order (see [Breadth-First traversal](https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/tree/breadth-first/))
