# Tree Exercise

In this exercise you will implement, in Python, several Tree methods.

- `add(value)` - This method adds a key-value pair to the Binary Search Tree
- `find(value)` - This method returns the matching value for the given key if it is in the tree and `None` if the key is not found in the tree.
-  **Traversals**:  These methods return an array of dictionaries consisting of all the key-value pairs in the tree in a specific order.
    - `inorder` - This method returns an array of all the elements in the tree, in order.
    - `postorder` - This method returns an array of all the elements in a postorder fashion (left, right , root).
    - `preorder` - This method returns an array of all the elements in a preorder fashion (root, left, right).
- `height` - This method returns the height of the binary search tree.

## Optionals

- `bfs` - This method returns an array with the tree elements in a level-by-level order (see [Breadth-First traversal](https://medium.com/basecs/breaking-down-breadth-first-search-cebe696709d9))
